# Serverless API Example using SAM

This is a serverless API that can be deployed using AWS CloudFormation. Also includes sections for running unit tests and deploying SPA to S3. Best used with AWS CodePipeline. If you wish, you can use an already existing CloudFormation template that deploys a pipeline [here](https://github.com/tqhoughton/cloudformation-templates).
